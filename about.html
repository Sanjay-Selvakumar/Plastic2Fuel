                    <h3 class="text">This website helps us connect companies hoping to adopt sustainable plastic recycling practices and aviation companies aiming to reduce their carbon emissions and improve fuel efficiency in their flights. Our role is to act as the mediator between the companies involved and ensure that the supply meets the demands. We invite any company that produces plastic waste to become a sponsor. Doing so will grant you a variety of benefits and incentives through ECRs and other tax credits.</h3>

                    <h3 class="text">Researchers at University of Washington have found that using a ruthenium-on-carbon catalyst can melt plastic at tempratures as low as 220 degrees celcius in order to complete the hydrothermic process. The product of this process is a mixture containing approximately 85% jet fuel components or lubricant and 15% other byproducts such as methanol. Methanol is an essential part of the chemical industry and our byproducts can be outsourced to other industries or help sustain the factory itself.</h3>

                    <h3 class="text">We will facilitate the transportation of plastics from your location to a nearby factory or hotspot. Companies who contribute their plastic waste will be incentivized through many government programs such as carbon credits and other tax reduction initiatives that can greatly benefit companies and their profit margins.</h3>
